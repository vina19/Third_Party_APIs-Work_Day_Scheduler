# Third_Party_APIs-Work_Day_Scheduler
## Description
#### This repository is where I created a simple calendar application that allows a user to save events for each hour of the day from 9am-5pm. At the top of the calendar, the user would be able to see the current day and under it, the user would also be able to see time blocks with standards business hours and a place where they can input their schedule description. The user would also be able to see which event is in the past, present, and future by checking on its block color. Grey color would be for past event, red would be for the present, and green would be for an upcoming event. Lastly, the user would be able to save the event to the local storage. 

## Installation
